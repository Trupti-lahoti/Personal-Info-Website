            <p class="about__text">I have did my 6 months internship at Cynosure Software Solution @Ecokrypt as Product Developer.
                For Frontend i have used Angular and for backend it was SpringBoot with MOngoDB. It was really a new and amazing 1st experience in IT Organisation.
                For me all the things were new , it was quite challenging to deal with new technologies.
